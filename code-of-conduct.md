# Code of conduct


## How we plan to collaborate? 
We plan to work as a unit in this project , we will communicate and work together, using for example pair programming if needed, to fulfill the specified requirements given to us by the product owner. 

To organize our work, we will be working using Scrum. We plan on having Sprint planning sessions every Tuesday, directly after the Sprint Review, wherein we will discuss our plans for the upcoming Sprint and produce tasks to fill the Sprint’s trello board with. We have chosen Tuesdays for sprint planning because on Tuesdays we have hands on sessions with “product owner” Christian, where we can get a direct feedback and plan our next sprint base on it. Furthermore, some members like the cushion of the weekend to have some extra research time.

Team members are strongly encouraged to work at university since the car will always be here. Additionally, we decided that all team members will attend two of the supervision sessions a week, namely tuesdays and thursdays, where the whole team attends and work on the car together.

We will further organize our work by using Trello. Each Sprint, which consists of a week, will have its own board. The tasks for each sprint will be in a “To do” column which will be filled out during Sprint planning. Any member can choose the task they want to do and move it to “Doing”. Once they are done, they will move it to “Review” where it will be reviewed and approved by another member before it is moved to the “Done” list.

Furthermore, we will set up a car schedule. Each team member gets a two hour slot a day where they have priority on testing code on the car. Any other member is, of course, allowed to test their code with the car but with the understanding that the scheduled member has priority.

Lastly, we will have daily stand-ups every day, other than Saturday and Sunday which are free days where no member is required to work, in order to synchronize with the rest of the group on issues and progress. If we are on campus, the stand-up will be face-to-face, otherwise it will be conducted at 11AM on a dedicated Slack channel.

## Our intended way of communication within our group? 
Our main form of communication will be using Slack unless we are all in attendance on campus. We maintain the option to discuss matters on Discord as well should there be a situation where team members are unable to attend physically.

## How will we resolve conflicts?
There will be a dedicated time slot during the sprint retrospective to bring up issues related to group cohesion in order to solve issues that might cause conflicts within the group setting. Here we should discuss how we can improve communication, planning, work ethics, etc. If a conflict has arisen that has yet to be resolved during the work week this is the time to resolve it once and for all. All group members, whether part of the conflict or not should partake in resolving any issues that have arisen and, in so doing, improve our process and our collaboration.
This is bullet point of escalation, which is followed when subject has a issue.
```
This is an example where Jacob has an issue.
* Jacob calls a meeting to address the issue or adds it to the agenda of the sprint retrospective.
	**  All team members attend the meeting.
	**  This meeting is mandatory.
* It should be held in the same week as when Jacob called for one.
* Jacob names a moderator who isn’t part of the issue.
* Jacob talks about the issue initially in the meeting.
* The moderator moderates the discussion allowing all parties to speak and thus facilitating a solution.
* If a vote can solve the issue , then the moderator calls a vote. All team members get to vote and the majority rules.
* 3 days to check improvement if issue solved with someone’s behavior.
	**  If the issue isn’t resolved then a higher authority is brought in to help mediate the issue.
