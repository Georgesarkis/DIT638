## Processing image data with OpenCV using C++

This C++-template demonstrates how to develop a software module to process video data (eg., image detection, etc.) to be used with Kiwi.

Prerequisites:
* [You need to install Docker for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-docker-ce)
* [You need to install `docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
* You have a recording file (`.rec`) with some video frames.

### Building and testing the software module for your laptop (replay mode)

This template folder contains everything you need to compile and run a C++ software component that uses OpenCV for image processing. We are using Docker to build and run the resulting binary.

* Step 1: Assuming that you have a folder `~/recordings`, where you have at least one `.rec` file from your experiments with Kiwi.

* Step 2: Clone this repository:
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://git.ita.chalmers.se/courses/dit638/students/template
cd template/example_video
```

* Step 3: Now, you can start the h264 decoder and webapp for replaying as follows (the actual h264 decoder is built once during the first call):
```bash
docker-compose -f h264-decoder-viewer.yml up
```

* Step 4: Next, start a webbrowser and connect to your local webapp: http://localhost:8081 and open the folder view. Select one of the `.rec` files for replay and begin the replay to fill the shared memory with some image data; you can pause the replay shortly after you saw the image in your browser.

* Step 5: Next, you enable access to your X11 server (GUI; necessary once per login):
```bash
xhost +
```

* Step 6: Assuming that you are located in the `image-postprocessing-opencv-cpp` folder, you can build the software module as follows:
```bash
docker build -t myapp -f Dockerfile.amd64 .
```

* Step 7: Now, you can run your software component:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --init --net=host --ipc=host -v /tmp:/tmp -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY myapp --cid=253 --name=img.argb --width=640 --height=480 --verbose
```

The application should start and wait for images to come in. Now, continue to replay your recording; the C++ application should open a new window and display the frames. Furthermore, the code also display the distance readings from the sensors.

You can stop your software component by pressing `Ctrl-C`. When you are modifying the software component, repeat step 6 and step 7 after any change to your software.

After a while, you might have collected a lot of unused Docker images on your machine. You can remove them by running:
```bash
for i in $(docker images|tr -s " " ";"|grep "none"|cut -f3 -d";"); do docker rmi -f $i; done
```

### Deploying and testing the C++ application on Kiwi

When you are ready to test the features and performance of your software component on Kiwi in live mode, you need to build the software component for `armhf`. Therefore, you will find a file named `Dockerfile.armhf` in this template folder that describes the necessary steps to build your software component for `armhf`.

* Step 1: Have the previous tutorial completed.

* Step 2: **Make sure that you commented all debug windows from OpenCV as there won't be a GUI available on Kiwi.''

* Step 3: Assuming that you are located in the `image-postprocessing-opencv-cpp` folder, you can build the software module for `armhf` as follows:
```bash
docker build -t myapp.armhf -f Dockerfile.armhf .
```

* Step 4: After having successfully built the software component and packaged it into a Docker image for `armhf`, you need to transfer this Docker image from your laptop to Kiwi. Therefore, you save the Docker image to a file:
```bash
docker save myapp.armhf > myapp.armhf.tar
```

* Step 5: Next, you copy the image to Kiwi's *Raspberry Pi* using secure copy (`scp`):
```bash
scp -P 2200 myapp.armhf.tar pi@192.168.8.1:~
```

* Step 6: Afterwards, you log in to Kiwi's *Raspberry Pi* and load the Docker image:
```Bash
ssh -p 2200Â pi@192.168.8.1
cat myapp.armhf.tar | docker load
```

* Step 7: Assuming that the Getting Started Tutorial 2 (Controlling Kiwi using your webbrowser) is still running, you can finally run your software component next to other microservices on Kiwi's *Raspberry Pi*:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --init --net=host --ipc=host -v /tmp:/tmp myapp.armhf --cid=112 --name=img.argb --width=640 --height=480
```

Alternatively, you can also modify a `.yml` file from the Getting Started tutorial to include your software component:
```yml
    myapp:
        container_name: myapp
        image: myapp.armhf
        restart: on-failure
        network_mode: "host"
        ipc: "host"
        volumes:
        - /tmp:/tmp
        command: "--cid=112 --name=img.argb --width=640 --height=480"
```
